This tests a basic phase field crystal model as presented in Elder et al, 2002.
This is a test of the :ref:`Integrator::PFC` method, see that documentation for details on the method.
The main purpose of this test is to demonstrate the ability to solve phase field problems using spectral methods in Alamo.
