This problem is identical to :ref:`Voronoi`, but solves mechanical equilibrium in the microstructure with grain-dependent moduli.
This problem tests the following capabilities

- :ref:`Integrator::PhaseFieldMicrostructure`
- :ref:`Integrator::Mechanics`
- :ref:`IC::Voronoi`
- :ref:`Model::Solid::Affine::Cubic`

The following is the result in 2D:
