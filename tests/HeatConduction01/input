# description: Compute transient heat transfer simulation in 2D or 3D.
#              In this example the 3rd dimension (if used) is periodic so
#              the simulation is still 2D.
#              The boundary conditions are:
#                - Dirichlet in X and Y
#                    o  T=1 at x=0, y=0
#                    o  T=0 at x=1, y=1
#                - Periodic in Z
#              The initial condition is a circle (in 2D) and a cylinder
#              (in 3D) with Tin on the inside and Tout on the outside.
