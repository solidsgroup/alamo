This test demonstrates the use of the dynamics solver using the :ref:`Mechanics` integrator.
It is similar to the Eshelby test problem: the inclusion is given an eigenstrain and compressed.
This creates a stress wave at the interface into and out of the inclusion.
Viscosity is used to damp out spurious oscillations, and so the solution converges fairly quickly to the static solution.
