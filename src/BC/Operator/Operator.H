//
// The :code:`BC::Operator` family of BC classes are designed to work with implicit
// operators.
// **They are not the same thing as other BC types** and cannot be used in that same
// way. 
// (This is not an ideal taxonomy for BC structures - we may transition other BC types
// to be subspaces of BC::Integrator.)
