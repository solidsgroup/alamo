This is an Alamo input file builder for the **Integrator::Flame** method.
Enter values for the Alamo parameters, and an input file is generated at the bottom of this page.
Required parameters are indicated with red inputs.
Default values are indicated with placeholder values, and will not be included in the input unless
you put it in specifically.

.. warning::
   This is a new and very experimental Alamo feature.
   This form is entirely auto-generated based on the Alamo code base using the code scrapers.
   It is not currently complete (there are some known params that are not included)
   and it is also not yet thoroughly tested.

   Please use with caution.
