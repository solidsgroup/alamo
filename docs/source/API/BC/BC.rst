This is the documentation for the various boundary conditions that Alamo applies.
Boundary conditions are the constraints neccessary to solve a differential equation that has known conditions on the boundaries of the domain.
They specify the uniqueness of a solution, and arrise in any differential equation that is being solved spatially.
While there are a few key types of boundary conditions, their exact form depends on the application.
